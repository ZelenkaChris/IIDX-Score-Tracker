# IIDX-Score-Trakcer

Personal web application created to keep track of my improved scores over time for a game called 'Beatmania IIDX'. Due to other score tracking sites not showing detailed statistics, it was hard to players to keep track of their improvements. <br />

# iidx scrap.py
Python script which loaded a JSON file and outputted its contents into a .sql file, which is then loaded into the database. (Automation is removed from script) <br />
